# pdf-page-resizer
Simple Python 2 script for resizing PDF page  (e.g. graphics designs) so it match printer's requirements.

## TLDR:
I need to resize some graphics designs, because they didn't match my local printing company requirements. My file was to small to pass "online" checker.  I found that this will be fastest way of doing it. 

I used **PyPDF2** and Python 2 for this task.
```
pip install PyPDF2
```

### Run:
```
python resizer.py
```
